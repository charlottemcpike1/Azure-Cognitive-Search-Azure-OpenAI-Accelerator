    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

      "1. **Finite Markov Chain Description**:\n",
      "   - A discrete Markov chain is completely described by its initial distribution and its transition probability matrix^1.\n",
      "   - The transition probability matrix is stochastic, with all entries being non-negative, all column sums equal to 1, and no row containing only zeros^1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Application in Airborne Infectious Disease Transmission**:\n",
      "   - A combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Markov chain method was developed to predict transient particle transport in enclosed environments^2.\n",
      "   - The Markov chain technique was used to calculate transient particle concentration distributions, providing faster-than-real-time information about particle transport^2.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Fast Fluid Dynamics (FFD) and Markov Chain Model**:\n",
      "   - A study proposed a combined FFD and Markov chain model for fast predicting transient particle transport indoors^4.\n",
      "   - The solver for the FFD-Markov-chain model was programmed in OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD toolbox^4.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Spatial Markov Chain Model for Virus Spread**:\n",
      "   - A spatial Markov chain model was considered for the spread of viruses, representing a graph connecting nodes that represent humans^5.\n",
      "   - The model was extended to incorporate various lockdown scenarios^5.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Genetic Fitness Optimization Using Markov Chains**:\n",
      "   - Markov chains have been the basis of randomized approximation algorithms, combinatorial counting, statistical physics, and genetic computing^6.\n",
      "   - The efficiency of the technique in applications depends crucially on the rate of convergence of the Markov chain^6.\n",
